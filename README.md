# page-replacement-simulation
Implemented page replacement algorithms (FIFO, LRU, Random) from memory management concepts of Operating Systems in C for simulating process execution, achieving an average hit/miss ratio of pages referenced by running jobs and successfully swapping in an average of [number] processes during each minute-long simulation.
